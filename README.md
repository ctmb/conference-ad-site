Felix, Carson, Monica, Alan's 343 project repo

Alpine Castle provides guest with the opportunity to rent out a castle for different occasions. 
Although the current website provides users with general information about the venue, 
we thought it could use a few improvements to create a better overall experience for the user.  
Our team will be improving on the user interface and user experience of the website: www.alpinecastle.com. 
We want to create a cleaner and fresher design by upgrading the layout style. 
We also want to add features that will be useful for the user such as a creating a map that displays the location of 
the castle and creating a booking calendar using Airbnb API.
We will be using the Airbnb API, Bootstrap, Material Design Lite, Leaflet.js, and React to build our project.
